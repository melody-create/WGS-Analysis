Analysis of Whole Genome Sequencing Data from pooled n = 81 phenotypically mutant and n = 46 Wild-Type Danio Rerio (zebrafish) larvae
WGS: 30X coverage 150 bp paired end sequencing on NovaSeq 6000
With the goal of identifying a genetic mutation (SNP) in the phenotypically mutant larvae not found in the Wild-Type larave
